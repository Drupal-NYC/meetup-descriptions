## Migrating Revolutionary Output to Drupal 8 (Socialism & Orange Is the New Black) by Seth Fisher

We'll discuss in depth the largest challenge of the project - migrating links to YouTube/YT Playlist videos within body fields that open in a Colorbox modal. This involves:
* A (fairly complex) custom Migrate source plugin
* Multiple custom Migrate process plugins
* Multiple patches to the Video Embed Field module
* Multiple failed/discarded alternate solutions

We'll also discuss what the site is, and how it is constructed. The discussion of the Migrate plugins and Video Embed Field patches are geared toward developers (especially the source plugin). However, the overview of the site and the discussion of failed/discarded approaches are for a wider audience.
