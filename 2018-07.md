## Contain Yourself! Docker + Ddev as a local development environment by Jeff Markel

Ddev is a fairly new, Docker-based development environment (primarily) for PHP-based CMSes - Drupal, Wordpress, Backdrop, or Typo3. This _Lightning talk_ will focus on how to spin up quick new Drupal systems as needed, for development, testing patches, reviewing pull requests, or just trying out new modules.

### Bio

**Jeff Markel** is a System Architect and IT Manager at Johnson & Johnson. He’s been working with Drupal since 2004 and as a professional Drupalist since 2009. Prior to that he worked as a Java developer, a C/C++ programmer, and even as an Assembler programmer working for IBM, developing mainframe operating systems. When he’s not working, you’ll probably find him walking somewhere - he walked over 500 miles this May, just for fun, did a 30-mile walk from Jersey City, across the GW Bridge, and down to Battery Park last month and will be doing another 30-miler along the Jersey Shore in September.

## Migrating Revolutionary Output to Drupal 8 (Socialism & Orange Is the New Black) by Seth Fisher

We'll discuss in depth the largest challenge of the project - migrating links to YouTube/YT Playlist videos within body fields that open in a Colorbox modal. This involves:
* A (fairly complex) custom Migrate source plugin
* Multiple custom Migrate process plugins
* Multiple patches to the Video Embed Field module
* Multiple failed/discarded alternate solutions

We'll also discuss what the site is, and how it is constructed. The discussion of the Migrate plugins and Video Embed Field patches are geared toward developers (especially the source plugin). However, the overview of the site and the discussion of failed/discarded approaches are for a wider audience.

### Bio

**Seth Fisher** has been a Drupal developer for over a decade. He is from Staten Island, NY, currently living in Philadelphia, PA and working remotely as Lead Drupal Developer for Taoti Creative, a Washington, D.C. based digital agency.

Seth became involved in political activism in 2008, which coincided with his introduction to Drupal. Since then, he has used his skill set to help organizations in the arenas of socialism, anti-imperialism, and independent media. He has also written a television pilot screenplay about socialism, and performed standup comedy from a working class perspective.

## Tools to measure the health and security of your server by Scott Wolpow and Robert Rusinko

Let's face it, logs are dry, boring and a pain to read.

A servers health is directly related to security. Often the first sign is unusual loads on the server.

We will review some popular tools to look at your server and how to establish baselines.
