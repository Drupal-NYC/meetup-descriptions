## Using Drupal to create a digital patient education experience at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center by Kermitt Ramirez

At Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK), the Department of Patient and Caregiver Engagement is dedicated to communicating and engaging with cancer patients, their caregivers, and the public. Within the department, the Patient and Caregiver Education Program collaborates with healthcare professionals to provide accurate, clear, and reliable educational resources.

In this session, we will explore how MSK converted an analog educational resource library to a virtual one using Drupal, creating a dynamic digital experience for users. We will walk through each stage of our development and implementation process, including our experience customizing functionality for both internal and external users.

Additionally, we will explore various methods applied and technologies used to migrate, generate, translate, and manage educational resources in our virtual library.

This talk is suitable for beginners and more experienced Drupalers.

## UX Editorial Shift by Kevin Basarab

Normally in a web development agency, your focus is on the front end, consumer-facing side of a website. Yes, we talk about the administration but mostly defer to "it is what it is" and "that's just how Drupal works." With the rise in popularity of decoupled infrastructures, more clients are shifting their focus to improving the Drupal Administration UX.

From a business perspective, an editor often has more say in the support and success of your CMS then the end user browsing the site so the editor persona should be considered throughout the development process. In this session, we'll dive into the evolving Drupal 8 editorial user experience and contributing that back to the community. We'll explore things to think about plus modules and options for improving editorial UX without custom development work.

What to expect:
- How is design/UX reversing to focus on the editorial experience?
- What contrib modules currently enhance the editorial experience?
- How can a better editorial experience be beneficial to your client?
- Where is the future of editorial experiences and Drupal heading?

This talk is suitable for beginners and more experienced Drupalers.
