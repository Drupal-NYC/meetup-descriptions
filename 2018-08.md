## Contain Yourself! Docker + Ddev as a local development environment by Jeff Markel

Ddev is a fairly new, Docker-based development environment (primarily) for PHP-based CMSes - Drupal, Wordpress, Backdrop, or Typo3. This _Lightning talk_ will focus on how to spin up quick new Drupal systems as needed, for development, testing patches, reviewing pull requests, or just trying out new modules.

### Bio

**Jeff Markel** is a System Architect and IT Manager at Johnson & Johnson. He’s been working with Drupal since 2004 and as a professional Drupalist since 2009. Prior to that he worked as a Java developer, a C/C++ programmer, and even as an Assembler programmer working for IBM, developing mainframe operating systems. When he’s not working, you’ll probably find him walking somewhere - he walked over 500 miles this May, just for fun, did a 30-mile walk from Jersey City, across the GW Bridge, and down to Battery Park last month and will be doing another 30-miler along the Jersey Shore in September.

## Development Automation with Composer, Robo and Docker by Father Shawn

Drupal 8 is changing the culture of our development community with concepts such as "proudly invented elsewhere," and "get off the island." How do we actually do that? And how do we deploy the result? What is the workflow if we are using continuous integration?

We use three technologies to address these questions with our development teams. [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), the PHP package manager, gives us access to over 150,000 PHP packages from the wider PHP community and all the modules on drupal.org.  [Robo](http://robo.li/) is an open source task runner built in PHP and led by Greg Anderson, Michael Bodnarchuk, and Moshe Weitzman. Robo is used in Drush 9 and Pantheon's Terminus. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) allows the creation of a lightweight, portable, set of services for both local development and continuous integration.

Composer's event system and Robo power Docker based local development, setup, and continuous integration at [Digital Pulp](https://www.digitalpulp.com/). This session will examine how we integrate these tools. Attendees should be willing to use a command line interface to manage their project. After the session you will know how to install Composer and use it to manage Drupal modules, other PHP libraries, and javascript dependencies. You will also learn how to create and customize workflows using Robo. All of this will be explored in the context of Ballast, the tool we created for our team which automates development workflow from start to finish.
