## Managing MongoDB with Drupal by Scott Wolpow

MongoDB is a great database. It is also requires a learning new syntax. For some that is not an issue, but for most it is just another task. That is why Scott created Opsyd. Using Drupal you can edit a MongoDB instance directly. You can also create forms with Key level ACL. Add Drupal’s core features and you have a powerful tool, no compass required.
