## Content moderation is stable in Drupal 8.5.x. by Eric Sod

The Content Moderation module allows you to expand on Drupal's "unpublished" and "published" states for content. It allows you to have a published version that is live, but have a separate working copy that is undergoing review before it is published. This is achieved by using Workflows to apply different states and transitions to entities as needed.

We'll talk about how content moderation in core came about, look at examples, and discuss what's still to come, including the Workspaces module. The Workspaces module has been released as an experimental module in Drupal 8.6.x.

The content moderation configuration we will be discussing is available on GitHub (https://github.com/esod/content_moderation_configuration/tree/develop). There are instructions on how to apply the configuration in the README (https://github.com/esod/content_moderation_configuration/blob/develop/README.md).

## Creating a Drupal Local Host From A Multi-Site Repo with Docker by Darryle Steplight

Have you ever been in a scenario where you worked on multi-site setup, you only had access to the modules and themes folder for your specific site, and wanted to create a localhost to begin your dev work? Have you felt frustrated that you couldn’t just download the repo and database and spin up a local dev environment quickly? Have you looked online but all roads to using Docker and Drupal only show examples of what to do when you have access to the entire Drupal codebase? Fear not, this presentation is for you. I’ll walk you through some intro level Docker terminology and the common roadblocks to conquer rapidly when dealing with Docker in a multi-site Drupal setup.
